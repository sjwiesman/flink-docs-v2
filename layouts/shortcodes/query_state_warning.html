For streaming queries the required state to compute the query result might grow infinitely depending on the type of aggregation and the number of distinct grouping keys. Please provide a query configuration with valid retention interval to prevent excessive state size.
See <a href="/docs/dev/table/streaming/query_configuration">Query Configuration</a> for details.
